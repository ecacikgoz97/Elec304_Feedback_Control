This Project contains 2 Simulink file and 2 Matlab Script.

arm_angle_control_PID_with_hardware_model_protected_4.slx: Provided Project that is designed by me. Don't need any modifications, just use init.m script for test.

Propeller_Arm_Protected_deltaT_10ms.slxp: Need to be in same folder with "arm_angle_control_PID_with_hardware_model_protected_4.slx" and set it into plant by browsing it.

init.m: User can make all the initialization changes with that file while applying the provided tests. Details are commented in the sctipt.
  StepTime: the delay given in the input
  InitialValue: Starting angle (Starting Position)
  FinalValue: Desired Angle (Ending Position)
  deltaT: Time Step
  ArmStartingAngle: Defining the starting position that is connected to the plant (black box model).
  
test1.m: Used for Plotting. Needs modification for settling time.

#################### Training ####################
1. First initialize the test by using init.m
2. Run init.m
3. See the output from arm_angle_control_PID_with_hardware_model_protected_4.slx's Arm Angle Scope
4. Run tes1.m to get matlab plot
5. Modify settling time in test1.m, according to the matlab plots
